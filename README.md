# NC-DOS
Simple DOS OS made with Cosmos

![CI results workflow](https://github.com/new-cube/NC-DOS/actions/workflows/dotnettest.yml/badge.svg)
I can assure you that the OS works whenever I push to master ^ is wrong the dependencies cant be loaded for some reason

## Installation
Just plop the ISO file in any virtualisation software and you're good to go.
